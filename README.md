# Notice app

This repository includes the existing fraud analysis app and the KYC Notice Mailer with three notice types: KYC Notice, Payer / Remitter Statement Request, and KYC Prabodh Notice.

For Prabodh, upload an Excel containing only `BANK NAME` (or `Bank`) and `ACCOUNT NUMBER` (or `AC NO`). Store account numbers as text to preserve leading zeros. Select **KYC Prabodh Notice** in the mailer, upload the shared bank email directory, review recipients and preview the notice before sending. The notice subject comes from `assets/kyc prabodh.docx` and remains editable.

Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run with `streamlit run src/app.py`. Configure local Streamlit secrets as needed. Bank email directories, account spreadsheets, credentials and sent-mail records are not included; upload your bank email Excel in the app or provide a local `BANK MAIL.xlsx`.

Validation: 17 focused tests passed for Prabodh, existing KYC mailer and notice generation.
